# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
-Applied K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm in recognizing handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset. 
- Developed a system from scratch which includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0â€“9). Accuracy of the model was around 98%. Tech Stack - Python, ML(KNN), OpenCV, MNIST Database
